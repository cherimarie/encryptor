encryptor
=========

Fun command line encryptor/decryptor tool, based on [Jumpstart Labs tutorial](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/encryptor.html).

In cl_encryptor.rb, PASSWORD is my password of choice, encrypted with rotation of 13 then converted to an MD5 hash. You should replace it with your own password, thus concealed. If you change the rotation, also change the rotation for user's guess in line 9.
